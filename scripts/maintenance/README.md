# Maintenance Scripts

This folder contains operator-run diagnostics and historical validation runners.
Most files here are not part of normal CI/CD and should not be treated as app
entry points.

Keep these categories:

- Shared helpers, especially `_runner_common.py`.
- Reusable eval support, especially `score_orchestrator_eval_case.py`.
- Scripts imported by `app/tests/`.
- The latest live runner for a still-active validation track.
- Historical runners that still have direct unit tests.

It is safe to remove old one-off runner generations when:

- their result is already captured under `docs/roadmap/reports/` or
  `docs/roadmap/done/`;
- a later runner replaced them;
- no `app/tests/` module imports them;
- no active eval harness calls them.
- archived docs do not depend on the exact script path for reproducibility, or
  those docs are updated to mark the runner as retired.

Do not delete scripts from `scripts/evals/fixtures/` casually. Those fixtures are
reusable corpus data for future eval runs and several tests assume the eval
harness layout remains stable.

## Current Contents

- `_runner_common.py` - shared helper imports for runner scripts.
- `apply_openclaw_c1_patch.py` - version-pinned, reversible OpenClaw/pi-ai
  empty-tools compatibility patch applier for the deployed runtime.
- `check_openai_compatible_endpoint.py` - reusable endpoint diagnostic.
- `planning_contract_report.py` - reusable report, imported by `app/tests/`.
- `reflection_replay.py` - reusable offline reflection-quality diagnostic.
- `score_orchestrator_eval_case.py` - reusable eval scoring, imported by `app/tests/`.
- `phase10k_p2_live_pilot_runner.py` - imported by `app/tests/test_phase10k_p2_live_pilot_runner.py`.
- `phase18f_seed_real_session_evidence.py`, `phase18i_machine_a_limited_validation.py` -
  Phase 18F/18I evidence-generation harnesses (see
  `docs/roadmap/done/workflow/` for their reports).
- `workspace_collision_audit.py` - Phase 23B read-only Project workspace
  collision audit; imported by `app/tests/`.
- `sandbox_branch_cleanup.py` - Phase 22B-1X1 managed sandbox branch
  inventory and supported cleanup. Read-only by default (`--inventory-only`
  or no `--apply`); `--apply` deletes only `orchestrator/task-<execution_id>`
  branches through the same ownership validation as sandbox disposal and
  prints a before/after ledger. For dogfood admission, the managed-branch
  count is informational: require the inventory's `unsafe_count` and
  `unsafe_exact_collision_count` to be zero for the proposed next
  TaskExecution. A terminal/missing exact branch with zero commits ahead of
  canonical is cleaned by allocation; active, unique-commit, ambiguous, or
  canonical exact matches fail closed. Historical safe branches unrelated to
  the proposed execution do not block admission. Database-unavailable
  ownership is ambiguous and never authorizes automatic cleanup. See
  `docs/roadmap/done/phase22/phase22b1x1-dispatch-capacity-and-sandbox-retry-20260802.md`.
- `phase31_launch_precondition_f10_workspace_uniqueness.py` - Phase 31
  launch check (Phase 30F finding F10, closed operationally in Phase 30L):
  wraps `workspace_collision_audit.run_audit` and gates on a declared set
  of Phase 31 target project IDs, exiting non-zero if any target is
  unresolved or shares a resolved workspace path with another project.
- `phase31_launch_precondition_f11_autocommit_daemon.py` - Phase 31 launch
  check (Phase 30F finding F11, closed operationally in Phase 30L):
  detects the environment auto-commit daemon's commit-message fingerprint
  in a recent git-log lookback window and reports working-tree
  cleanliness; detection only, cannot disable the daemon (out of this
  repo's inspectable scope). See
  `docs/roadmap/workflow/phase31/phase31-launch-preconditions.md`.
- `phase31_launch_precondition_f12_workspace_registration.py` - Phase 31
  launch check (Phase 31BR): verifies every declared target project's
  resolved workspace has a matching `openclaw.json` agent entry before
  dispatch; detection only, never registers an agent (Phase 22C-0
  fail-closed posture preserved). See
  `docs/roadmap/workflow/phase31/phase31-launch-preconditions.md`.
- `phase31_certification_scenarios.py`, `phase31_certification_facts.py`,
  `phase31_certification_evidence.py`, `phase31_certification_validation.py`,
  `phase31_certification_runner.py` - Phase 31B Certification Execution
  Platform: scenario-contract registry, live-run acceptance-evidence fact
  assembly, evidence pipeline, validation pipeline, and the canonical
  Certification Runner (F10/F11/F12 preamble, live dispatch, replay). See
  `docs/roadmap/done/phase31/phase31b-certification-execution-platform.md`
  and `docs/roadmap/done/phase31/phase31br-launch-readiness-resolution.md`.

2026-07: removed 45 one-off T1/WorkingMemory confirmation and pilot runners
(`t1_*_runner.py`, `t1_*_driver*.py`, `wm_*_runner.py`, `wm_*_pilot*.py`,
`validate_incremental*.py`, `validate_repo_memory*.py`,
`hg_p2b_strict_validation_r4_runner.py`, `probe_incremental_output.py`,
`test_wm_off_runner_v3.py`) per the criteria above: each was a completed,
dated, project/task-ID-specific historical run with no `app/tests/`
reference and no active eval harness dependency; their findings remain in
`docs/roadmap/done/` and `docs/roadmap/reports/`.
