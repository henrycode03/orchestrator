# Orchestrator

Orchestrator is a FastAPI + React control plane for AI-driven development work. It manages projects, ordered tasks, execution sessions, change-set governance, scoped knowledge retrieval, and a mobile-facing API — with backends ranging from local OpenClaw to native Ollama to OpenAI.

## What It Does

- Plan and execute development tasks via configurable AI backends
- Review, approve, or hold workspace changes before they are promoted
- Retrieve scoped knowledge during planning, validation, and failure handling
- Monitor session health, outcome rates, and security events from a dashboard
- Bridge to ClawMobile and OpenClaw via a mobile API layer

## Supported Backends

| Backend | Use case |
|---|---|
| `local_openclaw` | Linux/Ubuntu with OpenClaw installed (default) |
| `remote_openclaw_gateway` | Registered for future remote OpenClaw use; not implemented for runtime use yet |
| `openai_responses_api` | OpenAI API (cloud) |
| `direct_ollama` | Native Ollama, no OpenClaw needed — Windows or air-gapped |

`direct_ollama` is planning-first: it supports planning and structured file operations, but not native shell/tool execution. Use `local_openclaw` for full agent execution.

Backend routing is lane-aware. `AGENT_BACKEND` is the default runtime, while
`PLANNING_BACKEND`, `EXECUTION_BACKEND`, `REPAIR_BACKEND`, and
`DEBUG_REPAIR_BACKEND` can override specific lanes. Blank lane overrides fall
back to `AGENT_BACKEND`. Direct planning repair is configured separately with
`PLANNING_REPAIR_BASE_URL`, `PLANNING_REPAIR_MODEL`, and
`PLANNING_REPAIR_API_KEY`; there is no `PLANNING_REPAIR_BACKEND` setting.

## Current Architecture Notes

- **Bootstrap Contract** — first ordered implementation tasks are validated by
  a deterministic bootstrap contract before execution.
- **BootstrapTaskType** — Phase 12T classifies bootstrap tasks as
  `SOURCE_CODE`, `ARTIFACT_ONLY`, `MIXED`, or `UNKNOWN`. Artifact-only tasks do
  not require source-code implementation files; source-code, mixed, and unknown
  tasks remain conservative.
- **Repair arbitration** — Phase 12U made planning repair acceptance depend on
  Bootstrap Contract validity. A repaired Task 1 candidate that violates the
  contract is rejected with `repair_candidate_rejected_by_bootstrap_contract`
  diagnostics instead of being counted as accepted progress.
- **Test-file calibration** — Phase 12V added `expected_test_reason`
  diagnostics so checklist/report lifecycle language does not automatically
  become a source-code test-file requirement.

## Key Features

- **Multi-backend runtime** — choose a default backend with `AGENT_BACKEND` and optional lane-specific overrides
- **Workflow templates** — YAML-defined governance per task shape; auto-promote or hold based on warning flags
- **Change-set review policy** — auto_publish_all / hold_nontrivial / hold_all; full operator override trail
- **Knowledge layer** — SQLite/Qdrant runtime with task-type and failure-signature gates; session logs expose `knowledge_used`, retrieval reason, top items, and phase
- **Security audit** — command, path, quota, and retention policy checks; shadow-mode audit on every execution
- **Outcome classification** — terminal reasons tracked, aggregated at `/admin/outcome-rates`
- **Production observability** — `/health`, `/ops/metrics/summary`, `/ops/backends`, Langfuse tracing optional
- **Session lifecycle** — start, pause, resume, stop, checkpoint, retry, cross-session diff
- **Mobile bridge** — `/api/v1/mobile/*` endpoints for ClawMobile and OpenClaw status queries
- **React dashboard** — projects, tasks, sessions, settings, operator review queue

## Quick Start

See the [Setup Guide](SETUP.md) for step-by-step instructions:

- **Linux / Ubuntu** (with OpenClaw) → [Linux setup](SETUP.md#linux--ubuntu-with-openclaw)
- **Windows WSL2** (Ollama, no OpenClaw) → [Windows Ollama setup](SETUP.md#windows-nvidia-gpu--ollama-no-openclaw)
- **Windows WSL2** (llama.cpp, no OpenClaw) → [Windows llama.cpp setup](SETUP.md#windows-llamacpp-no-openclaw)

Linux `start.sh` runs the API, worker, Qdrant, and React dashboard as native processes. Windows/WSL Docker setup uses `docker-compose.windows.yml` for the API, worker, Redis, and Qdrant. On the compact Ollama laptop, use `./wsl-start.sh --ollama`; on the llama.cpp Windows device, use plain `./wsl-start.sh`. Use the ingest command for the runtime you are actually running: native Linux uses `venv/bin/python scripts/ingest_knowledge.py --source-dir . --qdrant-url http://localhost:6333`; Docker/WSL Ollama uses `./wsl-start.sh --ollama --ingest-knowledge`.

## Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Backend | Python 3.12, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Celery |
| Frontend | React 19, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind |
| Database | SQLite (`orchestrator.db`) |
| Queue | Redis |
| Vector store | Qdrant |
| Auth | HTTP-only session cookie for dashboard routes; JWT bearer support for token/mobile flows |

## API and Authentication

All versioned API routes are mounted under:
```http
/api/v1
```

Dashboard login uses a session cookie through:
```http
POST /api/v1/auth/session/login
```

For compatibility with older clients, auth is also mounted at `/auth/*`, but new clients should use `/api/v1/auth/*`.

Bearer tokens are still supported for token/mobile flows:
```http
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

Mobile bridge uses a shared key:
```http
X-OpenClaw-API-Key: <shared_key>
```

## Health Check

```
GET /health
```
Returns `200 healthy` or `503 degraded` with a per-dependency breakdown.

## Workspace Paths

Projects store `workspace_path` as a root-relative slug. API responses also include `resolved_workspace_path`; use that field when a script needs filesystem access. In Docker, resolved paths are under `/app/projects`. Host-side scripts should map that to the configured host project root, normally e.g. `/home/user/projects`, instead of resolving the slug against the repository checkout.

## Useful Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `./start.sh` | Start full stack (Linux native) |
| `./wsl-start.sh --ollama` | Start WSL Docker backend and dashboard for Windows-host Ollama |
| `./wsl-start.sh --ollama --no-frontend` | Start WSL Docker backend only for Windows-host Ollama |
| `./wsl-start.sh` | Start WSL Docker backend and dashboard for the Windows llama.cpp device |
| `./wsl-start.sh --ollama --ingest-knowledge` | Start Ollama WSL runtime and ingest `knowledge/` into Docker runtime |
| `./stop_all.sh` | Stop all processes |
| `./scripts/orchestrator-mobile-api.sh` | Query mobile API from shell |
| `./scripts/security_check.sh` | Run security audit |
| `./scripts/capture_replay_report.py` | Replay and report execution evidence |

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `SECRET_KEY is unset` | Set a real `SECRET_KEY` in `.env` |
| API calls fail from frontend | Check `VITE_API_URL` and `logs/backend.log` |
| Login calls hit `/auth/session/login` | Rebuild/restart backend/frontend; current frontend normalizes API base to `/api/v1`, and backend keeps `/auth/*` as compatibility |
| Celery jobs don't run | Confirm Redis is up; check `logs/worker.log` |
| Project files appear inside repo checkout | Use API `resolved_workspace_path`; do not resolve relative `workspace_path` against the current shell directory |
| Ollama not reachable from container | Set `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0` on Windows host |
| Mobile status pages empty | Set `MOBILE_GATEWAY_API_KEY` in `.env` |
| OpenClaw operations fail | Confirm `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL` points to port `8000`, not `8001` |
