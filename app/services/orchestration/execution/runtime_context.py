"""Runtime Executor Context (Phase 23D).

Phase 23C introduced a Task Execution Sandbox but wired it into dispatch as
a bare `TaskSandbox` object plus two independently-set attributes
(`orchestration_state._project_dir_override` and
`OpenClawSessionService.execution_cwd_override`) that happen to agree by
construction, not by a shared source of truth. This module gives execution
one object -- `RuntimeExecutorContext` -- that carries every piece of
runtime identity a dispatch needs, so downstream consumers (the execution
loop, the OpenClaw execution cwd, the workspace contract, the executor
workspace binding layer, disposal) read one constructed value instead of
each independently re-deriving or being independently told the same thing.

Not a redesign of the Phase 23A/23B/23C model: `runtime_workspace` is
exactly what `_project_dir_override` already pointed at (the Task Execution
Sandbox when one is allocated, otherwise the Project Workspace itself);
`project_workspace` is exactly `canonical_baseline_dir`/the resolved
project root. This module only stops that pair of facts from being carried
as two loose local variables.
