"""Provider-free Git-tracked orientation for one bounded discovery action.

Orientation is a *factual advisory* surface: it enumerates Git-tracked,
product-owned relative paths whose path text contains exact task literals, so
the single existing bounded discovery action can choose its scopes and query
with real repository vocabulary visible instead of guessing it.

It is deliberately not a search subsystem.  There is no ranking, no synonym
generation, no embedding, no index, and nothing is persisted: the enumeration
is derived from the Git index for the current request and discarded with it.
Visibility here grants no authority — an oriented path is never ``expected``,
never ``creation_authorized``, and never enters an APA.
