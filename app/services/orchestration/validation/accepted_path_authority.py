"""Accepted Path Authority construction at Plan acceptance (Phase 33C-3).

The single architectural rule this module implements:

.. code-block:: text

    task text and source grounding define the MAXIMUM scope
    the Plan REQUESTS a concrete scope
    Plan Validator GRANTS it, deterministically, only after acceptance
    AcceptedPathAuthority freezes the grant

Nothing here derives authority from a Change Set, from Execution output, from
candidate paths, or from any observation.  Those all happen later and must stay
incapable of granting authority, so ``execution_observed`` and
``change_set_observed`` are not representable at all (see
:class:`~.path_authority.GrantProvenance`).

This module owns the *construction* of the authority; the value object, its
identity, and its serialization live in :mod:`.path_authority` and are not
duplicated here.  Phase 33C-4 reconstructs the persisted record at Execution;
no later candidate, repair, Change Set, or publication stage may treat it as a
new grant source.

    of a grant is denial, which is the fail-closed default.

    Grant construction, entirely from facts that already exist at acceptance:

    ``existing_mutable``
        the record is source-grounded ``SOURCE_STATUS_EXISTING`` **and** the
        accepted Plan requests a mutating structured file operation on it.  The
        authorization decision itself is not re-implemented here: acceptance is
        the decision.  ``_source_operation_contract_issues`` requires a complete
        structured ``write_file`` operation for an existing-file whole-file
        mutation; an ungrounded or otherwise unauthorized write never reaches an
        accepted status and never reaches this function.

    ``existing_readonly``
        source-grounded ``SOURCE_STATUS_EXISTING`` with no requested mutation.
        Materialization admitted the file as readable context the accepted Plan
        has no authority to change.

    ``creation_authorized``
        source-grounded ``SOURCE_STATUS_NEW`` (which the materializer sets only
        when ``creation_authorized`` holds) **and** the accepted Plan actually
        requested the creation.  A path that is merely creation-eligible is not
        granted: the Plan must request, the validator must grant.

    ``deletion_authorized``
        never constructed.  Plan validation performs no deterministic deletion
        authorization today — ``delete_file`` is a supported op shape but no
        source-grounding or task rule grants it, and the class additionally
        requires a baseline content hash that no deletion decision produces.
        Inferring deletion authority from a later observation (a missing file, a
        Change Set ``deleted_files`` entry, Execution behaviour) is exactly the
        category error this contract exists to remove, so the limitation is left
        explicit rather than papered over.

    ``accepted_creation_paths`` and ``accepted_existing_mutation_paths`` are
    narrow facts returned by the existing Plan Validator contract.  They cover
    the two accepted shapes where the validator deliberately permits a
    write-side operation without a source-materialization record.  Creation is
    still safe to represent because its grant carries no baseline hash.  An
    existing-file write is deliberately rejected here when its source evidence
    is absent: manufacturing an existing-file baseline digest would either be
    a whole-file mutation fence or fabricated evidence.
