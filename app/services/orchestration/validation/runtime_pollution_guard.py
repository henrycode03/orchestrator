"""Detects unexpected top-level runtime artifacts left by OpenClaw execution.

Phase 22C-0 containment. OpenClaw writes its own per-workspace
agent-identity/onboarding scaffold (`SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, `TOOLS.md`,
`HEARTBEAT.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `.openclaw/`) into whatever directory an
agent's configured workspace points at. Prior fixes suppressed this by adding
each observed filename to `HYDRATION_EXCLUDED_NAMES`
(`app/services/workspace/workspace_paths.py`) -- an ever-growing blacklist
that only hides files git/hydration already knows about and says nothing
about a scaffold rename or a new file OpenClaw has never written before.

This module adds a second, non-blacklist detector: a plain before/after diff
of the project root's top-level entries for each execution. Any new entry is
reported; entries matching the known scaffold name set are called out
specifically because they are unambiguous (never legitimate task output), but
detection itself does not depend on that list -- an unrecognized new
top-level artifact is still surfaced.

This module only detects and reports. It does not delete or modify anything
in the project workspace -- removing files from a directory Orchestrator does
not own is itself a boundary violation.
