"""One authoritative location contract for Orchestrator-owned durable control state.

Durable control state (event journals, fingerprints, change-sets, the project
state manager snapshot, task reports) is written by the Orchestrator *about* a
project; it is not project content.  It therefore belongs under the configured
Orchestrator runtime root, not inside the project repository.

Identity and location are separate concerns:

    Project identity  ->  ControlStateLocation  ->  on-disk path

``ControlStateLocation`` carries the durable ``Project.id`` alongside the legacy
on-disk root, so producers/consumers can hand identity across the existing
``project_dir=`` boundary without any caller inferring identity from a path.

Relocation contract (this gate):

* **Write** goes to ``<runtime_root>/control/projects/<project_id>/<family>``
  whenever the location carries a resolved ``control_root``.
* **Read** prefers that location and falls back to the historical
  ``<legacy_root>/.agent/<family>`` when the new artifact does not exist.
* A location *without* a ``control_root`` is a legacy-scoped location and keeps
  the pre-relocation behaviour exactly.  ``control_root`` is only ever supplied
  by an identity-aware boundary (``project_control_state_location``), never
  inferred from a path and never resolved implicitly on a write.

No historical data is migrated, rewritten, or deleted by this contract.
