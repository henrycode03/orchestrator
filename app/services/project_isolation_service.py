### 🛡️ PROJECT ISOLATION SAFETY NOTICE

**Current Project:** Project ID {project_id}
**Workspace Root:** {project_root}

**RULES:**
1. ✅ You MAY read/write files within: {project_root}
2. ❌ You MUST NOT access files outside this directory
3. ❌ You MUST NOT modify system files or other projects
4. ⚠️  If you need to access external resources, ask the user for permission

**PATH VALIDATION:**
- All file operations will be checked against this boundary
- Attempts to escape will be logged and may be blocked
- Use relative paths when possible (e.g., "src/main.py" not "/root/...")
- ❌ DO NOT attempt to write to paths like "../../../etc/passwd" or "shell://command"
- ❌ DO NOT generate code that tries to escape the project boundary

**VERIFICATION TESTS:**
If you need to verify isolation is working, use the API endpoint:
- GET /api/v1/projects/{{project_id}}/isolation/validate
- POST /api/v1/projects/{{project_id}}/isolation/validate with {{"path": "test.txt"}}

**SAFETY FIRST:**
If you're unsure whether a path is safe, ASK before executing.
Do NOT attempt to break the isolation - it's already enforced.
