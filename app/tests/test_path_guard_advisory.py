"""Tests for Phase 1 advisory path guard (detect_advisory_nested_scaffold).

All six scenarios from the design doc:
  1. write_file into existing package dir  -> no advisory
  2. write_file into new scaffold dir      -> advisory emitted, returns advisory (not raises)
  3. top-level file (README.md)            -> no advisory
  4. assets/logo.png                       -> no advisory (non-scaffold single file)
  5. .github/workflows/ci.yml             -> no advisory (hidden dir)
  6. advisory never raises                -> function returns list, never raises

The helper is pure (no I/O, no DB).  Tests run without any fixtures.
